# Tera Raid Battle Calculator

A modern web application built with React and TypeScript that helps Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet players find good counters to their tera-raid opponent.

## Counter Calculation Logic

The calculator uses a sophisticated scoring system that considers:
1. Type effectiveness against both original and tera types
2. Defensive capabilities (HP, Defense, Sp. Defense)
3. Offensive potential (Attack, Sp. Attack)
4. Speed tier advantages
5. Immunity interactions
6. STAB potential
